One way to make a query run faster is to reduce the number of calculations that
need to be performed. Some of the high-level things that will affect the number
of calculations a given query will make include:

a. Table size
b. Joins
c. Aggregations

Query runtime is also dependent on some things that you canâ€™t really control
related to the database itself:
a. Other users running queries concurrently on the database
b. Database software and optimization (e.g., Postgres is optimized differently than Redshift)


1. if you have time series data, limit to a small time window
2. test you query on a subset of data, finalizing the query,
   then remove the subset limitation
3. limit the amount of data that you are working with in the place where it
    will be executed first
4. reduce table size before joining
5. worry about accuracy before worrying about speed
6. use EXPLAIN to get a sense how long the query will run
7. pre-aggregate subqueries before JOIN
